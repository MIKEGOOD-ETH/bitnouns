# WTF is Noun Site?

First there was NounsDAO.

Next came Lil Nouns.

Then came bitNouns.

An expansion DAO based on Lil Nouns DAO, bitNouns works to create another layer within the Nounish ecosystem; The teeniest tiniest Noun yet.

By expanding the ecosystem, bitNouns aims at exposing more people to Lil Nouns, and in turn Nouns DAO/the entire Nounish ecosystem via a practically free way to participate.
